        "description": "Public-key crypto based on factoring. Used for encryption & signatures",
        "intro": "RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. The encryption key is public and distinct from the decryption key which is kept secret (private).",
        "security": "The security of RSA relies on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers - the factoring problem.",
